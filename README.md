    - **Severity**: High
    - **Benefits**: Prevents tampering and enhances app security.

- **Emulator Detection**: Identifies if the app runs in an emulator, a common tool for reverse engineering.
    - **Severity**: High
    - **Benefits**: Reduces the risk of reverse engineering and debugging attacks.

- **Debugger Detection**: Identifies debuggers attached to the app.
    - **Severity**: High
    - **Benefits**: Increases resistance to runtime inspection and protects sensitive data.

- **Malicious Root App Detection**: Flags root management apps that can compromise security.
    - **Severity**: Medium
    - **Benefits**: Safeguards user data from root-level threats.

### OS Integrity
- **ADB Wireless/USB Debugging Detection**: Flags if ADB debugging is enabled.
    - **Severity**: Low
    - **Benefits**: Protects against unauthorized debugging and data exposure.

- **Developer Mode Detection**: Identifies if developer mode is active.
    - **Severity**: Low
    - **Benefits**: Minimizes attack surface by disabling additional tools for attackers.

### Secure Communication
- **VPN Detection**: Checks if the app is accessed over a VPN.
    - **Severity**: Low
    - **Benefits**: Provides network security insights.

### Mobile Privacy
